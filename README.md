# -Streamlit-Application-for-Diabetes-Prediction
This web-based application uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on user-inputted health metrics. Built with Streamlit, it offers an intuitive interface for both healthcare professionals and individuals to explore risk factors and receive instant predictions.
 Key Features:
- User Input Form: Collects key health indicators such as glucose level, BMI, age, blood pressure, and insulin levels.
- Prediction Engine: Uses a trained ML model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or SVM) to assess diabetes risk.
- Real-Time Results: Displays prediction outcome instantly with confidence scores.
- Data Visualization: Includes charts to show feature importance and dataset distribution.
- Model Insights: Explains how different features influence the prediction using SHAP or similar tools.
Purpose:
This project demonstrates how data science and healthcare can intersect to provide accessible, preventive tools. Itâ€™s designed to raise awareness, support early detection, and showcase the practical application of machine learning in medical diagnostics.

Step by step process:
1.Data preprocessing:create a notebook named data preprocessing and copy the code and paste and apply a dataset according to your project
2.Dash(plotly):To create a interactive dashboard copy the code and paste and after running the code u can upload your dataset and visualize your datasset through line,bar chart,histogram,scatter,box plot.
3.Streamlit:The final and important step is to create a python file copy and paste the code and open a new terminal and install all the prerequisties and run the following command (streamlit run filename)then the streamlit you can upload your dataset and  can view the info about your data and dashboards  as well in web app
