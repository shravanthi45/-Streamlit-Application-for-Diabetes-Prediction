# -Streamlit-Application-for-Diabetes-Prediction
This web-based application uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on user-inputted health metrics. Built with Streamlit, it offers an intuitive interface for both healthcare professionals and individuals to explore risk factors and receive instant predictions.
 Key Features:
- User Input Form: Collects key health indicators such as glucose level, BMI, age, blood pressure, and insulin levels.
- Prediction Engine: Uses a trained ML model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or SVM) to assess diabetes risk.
- - Real-Time Results: Displays prediction outcome instantly with confidence scores.
- Data Visualization: Includes charts to show feature importance and dataset distribution.
- Model Insights: Explains how different features influence the prediction using SHAP or similar tools.
Purpose:
This project demonstrates how data science and healthcare can intersect to provide accessible, preventive tools. Itâ€™s designed to raise awareness, support early detection, and showcase the practical application of machine learning in medical diagnostics.
